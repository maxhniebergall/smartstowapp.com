                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <div class="blog-intro">
                        <p class="lead-paragraph">If you're moving, organizing your garage, or just trying to get control of your storage, you've faced "The Problem": you own a lot of stuff, and you only have the slimmest idea where most of it is.</p>

                        <p>Losing items is stressful and expensive. One study found the average person loses items worth over £400 during a move.</p>

                        <p>So, what's the best way to fix it? You've probably tried a few methods already. Let's be honest about what works and what doesn't.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The 'Old Way' (And Why It Fails)</h2>

                    <p>These are the methods everyone tries, and they fail for one simple reason: <strong>they create extra work</strong> exactly when you don't have the time or energy.</p>

                    <h3>Method 1: Writing on the Box</h3>

                    <p>This is the classic "solution". You grab a marker and write "Living Room - Misc" on the side of a box. A week later, you're on your hands and knees, moving a 40-pound box just to read a label that tells you nothing. When you need the one specific thing (like the TV remote), you still have to open every box.</p>

                    <h3>Method 2: Using a Spreadsheet</h3>

                    <p>This feels more organized, but it's clunky and inconvenient. It forces you to interrupt your workflow. You have to put down the item you're packing, go to your laptop, and manually type in a new row. It's slow, full of typos, and by the third box, you'll give up.</p>

                    <h3>Method 3: Using a Notes App (like Google Keep)</h3>

                    <p>This sounds easier than a spreadsheet, but it doesn't solve the core problem: easing your stress while saving your time when you need it most. It's fine for a simple checklist, but it's not an inventory app. You still need to interrupt your packing to type every item individually, while being meticulously careful not to accidentally delete something or move it to a different box. You end up with one giant, barely-searchable note, if you don't give up six items in.</p>

                    <p><strong>These methods all fail because they force you to choose between packing and organizing. You need a tool that lets you do both at the same time.</strong></p>

                    <h2>The "Apps" Go Head-to-Head</h2>

                    <p>This brings us to dedicated inventory apps. This is where most people get overwhelmed, because the most-advertised apps aren't built for you.</p>

                    <p>They're built for <em>businesses</em>.</p>

                    <p>The simplest way to think about it is: <strong>Sortly is for business, and SmartStow is for home.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Sortly: "Best for Businesses & Complex Operations"</h3>

                    <p>Let's be clear: Sortly is a powerful and popular inventory system. It is built from the ground up to help small and medium-sized businesses manage their assets.</p>

                    <p>It's a great choice if you need to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Track SKUs and get low-stock alerts</li>
                        <li>Manage multiple user licenses for a team</li>
                        <li>Scan barcodes and manage asset check-in/check-out</li>
                        <li>Integrate with accounting software</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>SmartStow: "Best for Home Movers, Organizers, and Travelers"</h3>

                    <p>SmartStow was built to solve the stress and chaos of the <em>home</em>. We are designed for people: organizers, hobbyists, and anyone who has ever said, "I <em>know</em> I have one of those somewhere..."</p>

                    <p>To be completely transparent, we built our app by saying "no" to business features.</p>

                    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-color); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; font-style: italic; color: var(--text-light);">
                        <p><strong>Our "Cons" (Which Are Actually Our Strength)</strong></p>
                        <p>SmartStow is <strong>not</strong> built for complex enterprise asset tracking. We do not have purchase order management, low stock alerts, or team user licenses.</p>
                        <p>Our focus is 100% on being the fastest, simplest <strong>voice-first</strong> home inventory app.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The 'Hands-Full' Test: Logging Items <em>While</em> You Pack</h2>

                    <p>This is the moment that matters, and it's the fundamental difference.</p>

                    <p>With a traditional inventory app like Sortly, you must <strong>interrupt your workflow</strong>. You have to put down the item you're holding, take off your gloves, pick up your phone, and <strong>manually type</strong> the details.</p>

                    <p>Some apps even make you stick unique QR codes on every single box. It's slow and expensive.</p>

                    <p>With SmartStow, <strong>you just write a simple name or number on the box</strong> (like "Garage Bin 1" or "Attic Box 3"). You don't interrupt your workflow.</p>

                    <p>While your hands are full, you just say:</p>

                    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-color); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                        <p>"The 'camping stove', the 'water filter', and the 'lifejackets' are going in Garage Bin 1"</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The app logs it all, hands-free. Later, you just search for "stove" and SmartStow will tell you exactly where it is, instantly.</p>

                    <h2>The Pricing Comparison (Pay Attention to the Renewal Price)</h2>

                    <p>Because SmartStow is built only for home users, our pricing is simple and transparent. Business-focused apps often use confusing "first-year" discounts to hide a much higher renewal cost.</p>

                    <p>Let's compare the plans, item for item.</p>
