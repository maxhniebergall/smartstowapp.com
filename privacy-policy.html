            <p>When the legal basis for us processing your personal data is that you have provided your consent to that processing, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, it will not make processing which we completed before you withdrew your consent unlawful.</p>

            <h2>How Long We Store Personal Data</h2>

            <p>While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm.

            </ol>

            <p>When we transfer user personal data we will protect that data as described in this Privacy Policy and comply with applicable legal requirements for transferring personal data internationally.</p>
            <p>If you are located in the United Kingdom or the European Union, we will only transfer your personal data if:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The country your personal data is being transferred to has been deemed to have adequate data protection by the European Commission or, if you are in the United Kingdom, by the United Kingdom adequacy regulations; or</li>
