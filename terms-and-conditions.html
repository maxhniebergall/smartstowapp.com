            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: 10th day of November, 2025</p>

            <p>These terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions") govern the use of the <strong>StowSmart</strong> app (the "App"), <strong>SmartStowApp.com</strong> (the "Website"), and the associated <strong>backend app services</strong> (the "App Services"), which are collectively referred to as the "Site". This Site is owned and operated by The Good Business Software Company Inc.</p>

This includes, but is not limited to images, text, logos, documents, downloadable files and anything that contributes to the composition of our Site.</p>

            <h2>Accounts</h2>

                <li>All personal information you provide to us through your account is up to date, accurate, and truthful and that you will update your personal information if it changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you are using our Site illegally or if you violate these Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <h2>Sale of Services</h2>

            <p>The following services are available on our Site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to user inventory;</li>

                <li>Analysis of recordings for the purposes of inventory management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The services will be paid for in full when the services are ordered.</p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to all the services that are displayed on our Site at the time you access it. All information, descriptions, or images that we provide about our services are as accurate as possible. However, we are not legally bound by such information, descriptions, or images as we cannot guarantee the accuracy of all services we provide. You agree to purchase services from our Site at your own risk.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify, reject or cancel your order whenever it becomes necessary. If we cancel your order and have already processed your payment, we will give you a refund equal to the amount you paid. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor your payment instrument to verify receipt of any refund.</p>

            <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Your subscription automatically renews and you will be automatically billed until we receive notification that you want to cancel the subscription.</li>
            <li>Cancel your subscription renewal via the payment partner's app store through which your subscription exists (e.g., Google Play or Apple App Store). By default, users will retain access to the Backend for the remainder of the subscription period. See <a href=https://smartstowapp.com/account-deletion.html>https://smartstowapp.com/account-deletion.html</a> for details.</li>
            <li>Users without an active annual subscription will not have access to any of the App Services, including access to the user's Inventory, Inventory Management services, or recording analysis services, or any other paid services we may offer at the time.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to change subscription prices at any time, provided that we will not change the price of an active subscription until the next renewal date.</li>
            <li>If you do not maintain a continuous active subscription your data may be deleted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recording Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Recording analysis services are provided on the Site in accordance with our terms of service and privacy policy.</li>
            <li>Recording analysis services are subject to limitations based on the subscription plan you have purchased and the consumable "audio-minutes" you may have purchased or which may have been provided as an incentive for new subscribers.</li>
            <li>Recording analysis is provided without warranty or guarantee.</li>
            <li>The quality or accuracy of the recording analysis varies based on many factors and is not guaranteed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Audio-Minutes</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Audio-minutes have no cash value.</li>
            <li>Audio-minutes are non-transferrable.</li>
            <li>Audio-minutes expire 2 years from the date they become available in your account.</li>
            <li>Audio-minutes are consumed based on the length of the recording submitted for analysis, rounded up to the next second.</li>
            <li>Any refunds for audio-minutes will be prorated on usage.</li>
            <li>If, for whatever reason, you receive a non-prorated refund for consumed audio minutes, the full quantity of audio minutes (including consumed minutes) will be subtracted from your account balance, and your account balance might become negative. In the case of a negative balance of audio-minutes, future purchases of audio-minutes will be applied to the negative balance until it becomes positive. Recording analysis services are not available to accounts with negative balances, and you will need to purchase enough audio-minutes to achieve a positive balance before being able to use these services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Free Trial</h2>
            <p>We offer the following free trial of our services: Users will be provided with access to our manual inventory management services, as well as limited access to our automated inventory management services (i.e., recording analysis) for up to 30 days.</p>
            <p>At the end of your free trial, the following will occur: If you do not purchase an annual subscription before the end of the free trial period, your inventory data may be automatically deleted and will be unrecoverable. You will not be eligible for another free trial. To protect your inventory data from deletion, you must always maintain an annual subscription.</p>
            <p>To cancel your free trial, please follow these steps: Simply delete your account via the app, or email support@smartstowapp.com with the keyword "delete" from the email which you registered the account. Account deletion requests are subject to our account deletion policies.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>When you provide us with your payment information, you authorize our use of and access to the payment instrument you have chosen to use. By providing us with your payment information, you authorize us to charge the amount due to this payment instrument.</p>
